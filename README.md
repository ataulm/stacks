# Stacks

Stacks is a tree-based, infinitely nesting list manager, where leaf nodes represent action items.

A single **nist** is a shortcode (a short description, like a title) and an optional notes section (for longer descriptions).

Each nist can have an infinite number of children, but only one parent. In addition, a nist's ancestor is not eligible to be a parent. It is a tree.
